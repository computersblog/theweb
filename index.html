    <p>The World Wide Web (also known as WWW, W3, or simply the Web[1]) is an information system that enables content sharing over the Internet through user-friendly ways meant to appeal to users beyond IT specialists and hobbyists.[2]<br> 
      It allows documents and other web resources to be accessed over the Internet according to specific rules of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).[3] <br>

    <h2 id="who-make-www"> Who made the web? </h2>
    <p> The Web was invented by English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee while at CERN in 1989 and opened to the public in 1993. It was conceived as a "universal linked information system".[4][5][6] Documents and other media content are made available to the network through web servers and can be accessed by programs such as web browsers. Servers and resources on the World Wide Web are identified and located through a character string called uniform resource locator (URL). <br>

    <!-- History of Web -->
    <h2 id="whhistory"> History of the Web</h2>
    <p>The Web was invented by English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee while working at CERN.[11][12] He was motivated by the problem of storing, updating, and finding documents and data files in that large and constantly changing organisation, as well as distributing them to collaborators outside CERN. In his design, Berners-Lee dismissed the common tree structure approach, used for instance in the existing CERNDOC documentation system and in the Unix filesystem, as well as approaches that relied on tagging files with keywords, as in the VAX/NOTES system. Instead he adopted concepts he had put into practice with his private ENQUIRE system (1980) built at CERN. When he became aware of Ted Nelson's hypertext model (1965), in which documents can be linked in unconstrained ways through hyperlinks associated with "hot spots" embedded in the text, it helped to confirm the validity of his concept.[13][14] <br>

    <!-- What is a browser -->
    <h2 id="wibrowser"> What is a browser?</h2>
    <p>A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software user agent for accessing information on the World Wide Web. To connect to a website's server and display its pages, a user needs to have a web browser program. This is the program that the user runs to download, format, and display a web page on the user's computer. <br>
      In addition to allowing users to find, display, and move between web pages, a web browser will usually have features like keeping bookmarks, recording history, managing cookies (see below), and home pages and may have facilities for recording passwords for logging into websites. <br></p>
    <p> Some popular web browsers are Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari & more.</p>

    <!-- Diffrence between Browser and Search engine -->
    <h2 id="browser-searcheng"> The diffrence between Browser & Search engine </h2>
    <p>A web browser is a software application installed on your device (computer, phone, tablet) that allows you to access and view websites on the internet. It acts as an interface, retrieving web pages from servers and displaying them in a human-readable format, rendering the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that make up the page. Examples include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge.<br> 
    A search engine, on the other hand, is a website or a web-based service that helps you find information on the internet. It works by continuously scanning the web, indexing vast amounts of content, and then using algorithms to provide relevant results when you enter a search query. Examples include Google, Bing, Yahoo, and DuckDuckGo. <br></p>
    <p> These are the key main diffrences. <br>
